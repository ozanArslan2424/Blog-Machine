# Blog Machine for TPÖÇG

This is my first ever completed project. It's a simple application that let's a very particular type of blog post to be created by inserting image and text. This project was made for the TPÖÇG (Turkish Psychology Students Work Group) and it was quickly replaced by a more advanced version. This project was made with the help of the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
